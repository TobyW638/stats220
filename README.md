# stats220

## This is my repo for STATS 220. 

### A little about me:
<!--- numbered lists --->
1. *I am undertaking a degree in earthsci and stats*
2. I am taking STATS 220 because I want to learn more about stats
<!--- unordered lists -->
* I am interested in learning about how to code and how it can work in the real world

**A meme that captures how I currently feel about my university studies is**
