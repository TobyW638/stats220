# stats220

This is my repo for STATS 220. 

A little about me:

- I am undertaking a degree in earthsci and stats
- I am taking STATS 220 because I want to learn more about stats
- I am interested in learning about how to code and how it can work in the real world

A meme that captures how I currently feel about my university studies is ![](https://c.tenor.com/8druEACXtX8AAAAd/tenor.gif)
